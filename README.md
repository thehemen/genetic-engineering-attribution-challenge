# Genetic Engineering Attribution Challenge

The goal of [Genetic Engineering Attribution Challenge](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/63/genetic-engineering-attribution/) was to create an algorithm that identifies the lab-of-origin for genetically engineered DNA with the highest accuracy level possible.

## Main features

The benchmark is extended by more N‑Grams of the ACGT‑sequence as input of the FC network.

The main features of this work:
 - extended N-Grams (six-grams),
 - 8 fold cross validation,
 - separate preprocessing and training stages,
 - fully-connected neural network.

## Results

Public score: 0.9315.

Private score: 0.9181.
